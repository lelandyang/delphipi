# Steps #

  * Start DelphiPI
  * Select the folder where both package file (`*.dpk`) and source files (`*.pas`) reside.
> If the directory structure is like:

> SuperLibrary\packages
> SuperLibrary\source

> then just select SuperLibrary folder.

  * Specify a pattern that matches for your delphi installation. If you don't want to use a pattern just leave it as `*.dpk` and unselect the packages that are not suitable for your delphi installation.
  * Click Compile. Packages will be compiled and installed.
